# Cinder-0.9-Cookbook-Examples
Some examples for the fancy book [Cinder Creative Coding Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cinder-creative-coding-cookbook), upgraded for Cinder 0.9.+ and modern C++.

Even though a lot has changed in Cinder since the book was published, in early 2018 I still find it extremely valuable, and you can quickly upgrade the code and make it actual if you consulte the examples shipped with the current distribution of Cinder, search the forums and github. I give this book 5 stars and can still wholehartedly recommend it to anyone interested. You won't be disappointed. 

This repository is by no means complete, it follows my learning path, hope you might finde something useful in it. 

### Installation
It is assumed that your cinder repositoriy is called "cinder_master" and that you clone this one next to it. Then all the example projects should compile out of the box. 

Currently only maintained for MacOSX & Xcode.
